    DeePMD-kit is a powerful open-source software package that facilitates
    molecular dynamics simulations using machine learning potentials known as
    Deep Potential (DP) models. This package, which was released in 2017, has
    been widely used in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, and material
    science for studying atomistic systems. The current version of DeePMD-kit
    offers numerous advanced features, such as DeepPot-SE, attention-based and
    hybrid descriptors, the ability to fit tensile properties, type embedding,
    model deviation, DP-range correction, DP long range, graphics processing
    unit support for customized operators, model compression, non-von Neumann
    molecular dynamics, and improved usability, including documentation,
    compiled binary packages, graphical user interfaces, and application
    programming interfaces. This article presents an overview of the current
    major version of the DeePMD-kit package, highlighting its features and
    technical details. Additionally, this article presents a comprehensive
    procedure for conducting molecular dynamics as a representative
    application, benchmarks the accuracy and efficiency of different models,
    and discusses ongoing developments.
