    abstract = {We develop a new deep potentialâ”€range correction (DPRc) machine
             learning potential for combined quantum mechanical/molecular
             mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of chemical reactions in the condensed
             phase. The new range correction enables short-ranged QM/MM
             interactions to be tuned for higher accuracy, and the correction
             smoothly vanishes within a specified cutoff. We further develop an
             active learning procedure for robust neural network training. We test
             the DPRc model and training procedure against a series of six
             nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution that are
             important in mechanistic studies of RNA-cleaving enzymes.
             Specifically, we apply DPRc corrections to a base QM model and test
             its ability to reproduce free-energy profiles generated from a target
             QM model. We perform these comparisons using the MNDO/d and DFTB2
             semiempirical models because they differ in the way they treat orbital
             orthogonalization and electrostatics and produce free-energy profiles
             which differ significantly from each other, thereby providing us a
             rigorous stress test for the DPRc model and training procedure. The
             comparisons show that accurate reproduction of the free-energy
             profiles requires correction of the QM/MM interactions out to 6
             {\r{A}}. We further find that the model's initial training benefits
             from generating data from temperature replica exchange simulations and
             including high-temperature configurations into the fitting procedure,
             so the resulting models are trained to properly avoid high-energy
             regions. A single DPRc model was trained to reproduce four different
             reactions and yielded good agreement with the free-energy profiles
             made from the target QM/MM simulations. The DPRc model was further
             demonstrated to be transferable to 2D free-energy surfaces and 1D
             free-energy profiles that were not explicitly considered in the
             training. Examination of the computational performance of the DPRc
             model showed that it was fairly slow when run on CPUs but was sped up
             almost 100-fold when using NVIDIA V100 GPUs, resulting in almost
             negligible overhead. The new DPRc model and training procedure provide
             a potentially powerful new tool for the creation of next-generation
             QM/MM potentials for a wide spectrum of free-energy applications
             ranging from drug discovery to enzyme design.},
